Where am I ?
================================

This folder contains all presentation source files. All the folder it contains are the different presentation repositories. The only thing you will have to do in this folder is cloning or initialize your presentation repository. 

You have to use those folders NAME as first parameter to run smartRep (example `sr foo 1` to run presentation 1 from repo/folder `foo`).
