Where am I ?
================================

This folder contains files related to smartRep user interface (displayed by going on `http://your ip local network ip address:3000`) and files related to grunt tasks. If you  modify a file here, it is because you have to :

* Update user interface design

* Update or add a file used by Grunt to process a specific task

This folder is NOT used for styling, adding javascript or anything else related to your iRep application.
